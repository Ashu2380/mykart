- [ ] Add sound alerts for new notifications using open.mp3

- [ ] Implement priority-based styling (low, medium, high, urgent)
- [ ] Add state management for filters and apply to notifications
- [ ] Add navigation for action buttons using react-router-dom
- [ ] Test the upgraded notification system

## Dependent Files
